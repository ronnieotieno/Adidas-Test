## Prerequisite

This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
`gradlew build` command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio. To connect to API first set up [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in your local machine and clone `https://bitbucket.org/adichallenge/product-reviews-docker-composer.git` then run `docker-compose up` and wait for it to build successfully. Navigate to `~/src\main\java\dev\ronnie\adidasandroid\utils\Constants.kt` and replace `LOCAL_HOST` with yours. To make it work on your physical Android device put your internal IP address, [Check how to get the address](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-find-your-local-and-external-ip-address-5833108#:~:text=Open%20up%20the%20Command%20Prompt,is%20your%20local%20IP%20address.)

## App

The app loads the products of the API and displays them in a list. It also has Room DB for local cache.
The product list fragment has a search bar that filters the list based on the search query.
When the product is clicked, the app navigates to the Details fragment which shows a bigger picture, name, description on a collapsing toolbar, and a list of reviews. The user can click add review button and a dialog opens up and if their review was submitted successfully the review list is automatically updated.


## Architecture

The app is built using the MVVM architectural pattern and makes heavy use of a couple of Android Jetpack components. MVVM allows for the separation of concern which also makes testing easier. The app has a fragment that communicates to ViewModel which in turn communicates to the Repository to get data. 

## Testing

With MVVM testing is made easier in that Ui can be tested separately from the business logic. Mocking the ViewModel to test the fragment for user interaction using espresso, mocking the repository to test the ViewModel with Junit as well as mocking the API service/dao to test the repository using the Junit. The App has tests on Fragments, viewmodels, as well as network, calls under the Android Test package.
 
## Libraries

Libraries used in the whole application are:

- [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)ðŸš€
  - [Viewmodel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Manage UI related data in a lifecycle conscious way
  - [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - support library that allows binding of UI components in  layouts to data sources, binds character details and search results to UI
  - [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - Provides abstraction layer over SQLite
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Type-safe HTTP client and supports coroutines out of the box.  Used for the network calls.
- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) - Used to convert JSON to Java/Kotlin classes for the Retrofit
- [okhttp-logging-interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) - logs HTTP request and response data.
- [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) - Library Support for coroutines
-  [Dagger2](https://dagger.dev/dev-guide/) - Used for Dependency injection
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Allows for fetching and displaying of images to imageviews
